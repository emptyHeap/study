<h1>About Northeastern European Regional Contest</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Northeastern European Region Programming Contest
    is a part of the
    <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/acmicpc/">ACM International
    Collegiate Programming Contest</a>.
</p>
<p>
    ACM ICPC is a two-tiered competition among teams
    of students representing institutions of higher education. Teams
    first compete in regional contests held around the world
    from October to December each year. The winning team from each
    regional contest advances to the ACM International Collegiate
    Programming Contest World Finals, typically held the
    following March to mid-April. Additional high-ranking teams may
    be invited to the World Finals as wild card teams.
</p>
<p class="c">
<img alt="ACM Northeastern European Region consists of all former               Soviet Union countries except Ukrain and Moldova" src="../img/neerc-map.gif"></p>
<p>
    Northeastern European Region includes Russia and all former SU
    countries except the Ukraine and Moldova. The main site of
    Northeastern European Regional Contest (NEERC) is 
    <a href="http://www.ifmo.ru/" target="_top">St.Petersburg
    Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics</a>. 
    For the teams from
    Siberian Universities and Universities from Far-Eastern part of
    Russia the Siberian group at <a href="http://oasis.secna.ru/" target="_top">Altai State Technical University</a> was organized
    because the travel costs to St. Petersburg are too high for
    them. In the season 2000/2001 new Transcaucasian group was set up which
    central site is in Tbilisi at 
    <a href="http://www.gtu.edu.ge/index_e.htm" target="_top">Georgian Technical University</a>,
    in 2003/2004 season Transcaucasian group site was held in
    Yerevan.
</p>
<p>
    Due to large number of teams desiring to participate in this contest, in 
    1998 NorthEastern European Region was splitted into six subregions - Eastern, 
    Western, Northern, Southern, Central and Far Eastern. 
    In 1999 West Siberian subregion was introduced, and in 2000 also the East Siberian 
    one. Thus total number of subregions became eight.
</p>
<p>
    In 2002 Uzbekistan joined NEERC and new Middle Asia subregion was
    introduced, transformed to Uzbekistan subregion in 2004. 
    Since 2002 Transcaucasian group was considered subregion
    although it did not run subregional contest and teams from that
    group proceeded directly to regionals. It was transformed to two
    subregions - Georgia and Armenia in 2004, followed by Azerbaijan subregion
    in 2005. In 2003 Moscow was separated from  Central Subregion and now it runs 
    its own subregional contest. Kazakhstan also joined
    NEERC in 2003. Now there are fifteen subregional contests of NEERC.
</p>
<p>
    The best teams from these subregions 
    are invited to compete in North Eastern European Regional Contest. 
</p>
<p>
    Internet is used to provide participation of Siberian
    and Transcaucasian Universities in real time. The teams from the major Siberian
    Universities are gathered in the Federal node of the Russian
    Universities Network (RUNNet) in Barnaul and 
    the teams of Transcaucasian Group - in Tbilisi or Yerevan to participate under
    observation of the representatives of the Jury, who specially
    arrive to Barnaul and Tbilisi or Yerevan. Starting from 2004 the contest
    is also held in Tashkent for Middle Asia teams.
</p>
<h2>Rules Overview</h2>
<p>
    Contest rules are similar to the rules used in the Contest
    Finals of the ACM ICPC. Each team of 3 students is given one
    computer to solve proposed problems (usually 5-8 problems) within
    5 or 6 hours. Checking of solutions is made during the contest. A
    solution is accepted when it works correctly on the given set of
    tests (the time is although restricted). If a program fails, the
    Jury reports it to the team and adds a penalty time for each
    unsuccessful attempt. During the competition participants and
    observers have access to the preliminary results of all teams. 
</p>
<p>
    The team which solved more problems than any other team is
    considered to be a winner. In case of equal number of solved
    problems, the team with the lowest penalty time wins. A penalty
    time is a sum of time of solving of each problem plus 20 minutes
    for each unsuccessful attempt for solved problem. 
</p>
<p>
    The official competition language is English. All problems on
    the contest are given in English ONLY despite the fact that most
    of the participants speak Russian. This is so because the main
    goal of this contest is to select teams that will partipate in
    the contest finals, where the knowledge of English language will
    be critical to the team's problem solving ability.
